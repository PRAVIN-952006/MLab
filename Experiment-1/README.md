# Experiment 1: Working with Python Packages – Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Aim
The objective of this experiment is to explore essential Python libraries to perfrom data preprocessing, EDA, data splitting and performance evaluation on real-life datasets.

This is demonstrated using the **Iris dataset**, a well-known dataset for classification tasks.
