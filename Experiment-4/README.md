# Experiment 4 :  Ensemble Prediction and Decision Tree Model Evaluation

## Aim
To build classifiers such as Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Stacked Models (using SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) and evaluate their performance through 5-Fold Cross-Validation and hyperparameter tuning.
